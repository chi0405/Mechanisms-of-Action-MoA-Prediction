## 1. Introduction
In the realm of pharmaceutical drug discovery, understanding the Mechanisms of Action (MoA) is pivotal for identifying effective treatments. 
This project delves into a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and establishes a baseline model for the MoA competition, employing tidy R, ggplot2, and machine learning techniques.

## 2. Project Structure
The project is organized into the following main sections:
* Notebooks: The notebooks directory contains Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis, visualization, and model development.
* Data: The data directory houses the dataset files, including training features, targets, and additional relevant data.
* Visualizations: Visualizations generated during EDA are stored in the visualizations directory.
* Models: The models directory holds saved model files and related artifacts.
* Reports: Any project reports or summaries can be found in the reports directory.

## 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The EDA phase scrutinizes the dataset's file structure, individual feature visualizations, and interactions within and between feature sets.
Visualization techniques unravel patterns, distributions, and potential correlations, providing valuable insights for subsequent modeling.

## 4. Dimensionality Reduction and Baseline Model
To handle the complexity of the dataset, dimensionality reduction techniques, particularly Principal Component Analysis (PCA), are employed.
Following the EDA, a baseline model is constructed using Keras and tidymodels, leveraging machine learning to classify MoA responses.
